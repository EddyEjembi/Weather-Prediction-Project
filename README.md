# Weather-Prediction-Project
### A Weather Prediction Project using Machine Learning.

In today's world, accurate weather predictions are essential for planning daily activities, travel, and even long-term decision-making. Leveraging the power of Python and machine learning, I embarked on a journey to create a weather prediction project that offers insights into the future weather conditions of various cities. This project not only showcases the capabilities of machine learning but also provides a practical application of AI in our daily lives.

### The Project at a Glance
This weather prediction project enables users to forecast weather conditions for specific cities and dates. It's user-friendly and accessible through a web-based interface. Users can select their desired city from a list, choose a date, and receive accurate predictions for that day's weather. The available cities for prediction include Lagos, Port Harcourt, Kano, Abuja, Ibadan, and Ota.
